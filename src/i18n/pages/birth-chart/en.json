      },
      {
        "title": "What birth information do I need?",
        "description": "You need birth date, birth time (to the minute if possible), and birth location. Birth time matters for the rising sign (Ascendant) and houses. If time is approximate, planet signs and degrees are still useful, but houses may shift."
      },
      {
        "title": "How accurate are calculations?",
        "description": "We calculate geocentric planet positions from astronomical data and convert local birth time to UTC. Accuracy is strongest when time and birthplace are precise. If the time zone or location is wrong, Ascendant and houses can change—use the actual birthplace (or coordinates) when possible."
      },
      {
        "title": "Which house system is used?",
        "description": "This Birth Chart Generator uses Whole Sign Houses for a clean, beginner‑friendly wheel. The rising sign becomes the 1st house, then houses follow in order—making it easier to learn house meanings without visual clutter."
      },
      {
        "title": "What if I don’t know my exact birth time?",
        "description": "You can still use the Birth Chart Generator: planet signs and degrees remain meaningful. But the rising sign and houses can change quickly, so house themes may be unreliable. If you later find the exact time, regenerate for a more precise Ascendant and houses."
      },
      {
        "title": "Is this a substitute for professional advice?",
        "description": "No. Astrology is symbolic and interpretive, so use results for reflection and reference—not as medical, legal, or financial advice. Use the wheel + placements as a structured way to explore themes, then apply real‑world judgment and context."
      },
      {
        "title": "Sun sign vs Rising sign — what’s the difference?",
        "description": "Sun sign reflects core identity, Moon sign reflects emotional needs, and the rising sign (Ascendant) reflects how you meet the world. The Ascendant depends on birth time and location, which is why the same date can produce different rising signs in different places."
      },
      {
        "title": "What should I do after generating my birth chart?",
        "description": "Next, use Astrocartography. Your birth chart answers “who am I,” while Astrocartography explores “where do I thrive.” With the same birth data, the world map highlights location themes—useful for relocation astrology and “best places to live” exploration."
      },
      {
        "title": "How do I read a birth chart wheel?",
        "description": "Start with the rising sign, then find the Sun and Moon. Next, read planets by house theme (work, relationships, home, etc.). Use the placements list to confirm sign + degree so you don’t misread symbols. This matches long‑tail intent like “how to read a birth chart wheel.”"
      },
      {
        "title": "What are houses in a birth chart?",
        "description": "Houses divide the chart into 12 life areas (identity, money, communication, home, love, work, partnerships, transformation, beliefs, career, community, rest). Houses depend on the Ascendant, so birth time and location matter more for houses than for planet sign placements."
      },
      {
        "title": "Why does location change the Ascendant and houses?",
        "description": "Location changes the local horizon at your birth moment. Two people born at the same UTC time in different cities can have different rising signs and houses because the horizon shifts by longitude and latitude. Use the real birthplace (or coordinates) for the most reliable houses."
      },
      {
        "title": "What do degrees mean in astrology?",
        "description": "A sign shows the planet’s style; degrees add precision. Degrees help you compare charts, learn more advanced techniques later, and cross‑check results across tools. Start with sign + house meanings first, then return to degrees as you deepen your study."
