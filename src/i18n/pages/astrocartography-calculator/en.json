    "label": "Introduction",
    "description": "The Astrocartography Calculator is a professional-grade tool that projects your birth chart onto a world map, revealing where planetary energies are strongest across Earth's surface. This relocation astrology calculator uses Swiss Ephemeris astronomical data to calculate planetary positions with 1-mile accuracy, making it the most precise free astrocartography chart calculator available online.",

        "title": "How Does Astrocartography Calculator Work?",
        "description": "The planetary line calculator uses Swiss Ephemeris to determine each planet's position in the sky at your birth moment, then calculates where these planets were angular (rising, setting, culminating, or at nadir) across Earth's surface. This astro map calculator employs spherical trigonometry—using formulas like cos(H) = -tan(φ) * tan(δ) for ASC/DSC lines—to project planetary positions onto a world map. The locational astrology tool converts equatorial coordinates (Right Ascension and Declination) to geographic coordinates using sidereal time calculations, rendering visible lines that show location-specific energy patterns. This astrocartography chart calculator processes all calculations in real-time, displaying results on an interactive map with professional-grade accuracy matching industry-standard software.",

        "title": "What Astrological Parameters Does the Calculator Use?",
        "description": "The relocation astrology calculator processes nine planets (Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) and four angular points: Ascendant (ASC), Descendant (DSC), Midheaven (MC), and Imum Coeli (IC). For each planet, this planetary line calculator calculates its Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) at your birth moment, then determines where each planet was angular across Earth's surface. The astro map calculator uses equatorial coordinates for astronomical calculations and converts them to geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) for map display. This locational astrology tool automatically handles timezone conversions, historical daylight saving time rules, and calendar system changes, ensuring accurate angular house positions based on local sidereal time calculations.",

        "title": "How is Astrocartography Different from a Birth Chart?",
        "description": "A birth chart fixes your birth location and shows where planets were in the sky, while the astrocartography calculator fixes your birth time and shows where planets were on Earth's surface. The planetary line calculator displays results on an interactive world map with planetary lines overlaid geographically, making it easy to identify cities along specific planetary lines. A birth chart shows a circular diagram with houses and planetary positions for personality analysis. Use the astro map calculator when planning relocations, travel, or business locations based on planetary line positions. Use birth charts for self-understanding and personal development. This relocation astrology calculator complements birth chart analysis by adding a geographic dimension, revealing how changing locations affects planetary activation.",
