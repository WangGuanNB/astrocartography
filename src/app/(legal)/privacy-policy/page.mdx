# Privacy Policy for Astrocartography Calculator

## Introduction

Welcome to Astrocartography Calculator — an advanced astrology platform that generates personalized astrocartography charts and maps using professional-grade planetary calculations with Swiss Ephemeris and AI-powered interpretation technology. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have when using Astrocartography Calculator.

## Information We Collect and How We Use It

1. **Birth Data and Chart Calculation**

   - **What We Collect**: Birth date, time, and location data that you input for astrocartography chart generation.
   - **How We Process**: Our system calculates planetary positions using Swiss Ephemeris astronomical data and generates personalized astrocartography maps showing planetary lines across global locations. All calculations occur locally in your browser for maximum privacy. AI algorithms analyze planetary configurations to provide location interpretations.
   - **Storage**: We do not permanently store your birth data or generated astrocartography charts. Birth information is processed locally in your browser and never uploaded to our servers. Downloads and exports are delivered directly to your device without server storage.

2. **Account Information (if you create an account)**

   - **What We Collect**: Your name, email address, and other basic details you provide.
   - **Purpose**: To manage your account, deliver customer support, and provide any account‑related features you opt into.

3. **Usage Details**

   - **What We Collect**: Interactions within the app (e.g., features used, settings toggled), aggregated session data, and timestamps.
   - **Purpose**: To understand feature usage, improve performance, and guide product decisions.

4. **Device Information**

   - **What We Collect**: Device type, operating system, browser type/version, and basic technical diagnostics.
   - **Purpose**: To ensure compatibility, debug issues, and optimize performance across devices.

5. **Cookies and Local Storage**

## Data Storage and Security

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information. Where processing occurs in‑browser, your birth data and astrocartography charts stay on your device by default. For any data we do store, we employ encryption in transit, access controls, and monitoring. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited data:

- **Service Providers**: With vetted vendors who assist in operating the service (e.g., AI processing, analytics, payments), bound by confidentiality obligations.

- **Protection**: To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users, the public, or Astrocartography Calculator.
- **Aggregated Insights**: We may share anonymized, aggregated statistics that do not identify individuals.

## Your Choices and Rights

- **Preferences**: You can manage cookies/local storage through your browser settings. Some features may rely on these settings to function.
- **Access and Deletion**: If you have an account, you can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information.
- **Opt‑out**: You may opt out of non‑essential analytics where available.
